* Tricking Minds
  For want of a better name: I'll just refer the tactics of
  persuasion/marketing/nudge/gamification/seduction etc as "Tricking Minds".
** Who does that?
   * Marketers
   * app-creators
   * designers
   * policy makers
   * etc
** Why
   Trick people into consuming/using more than they would, Doing things they would not.
** Where
   * software
   * ads
   * positioning of sale points (think vending machines, kiosks, placement of things in a supermarket)
   * product design (thing Donald norman's view of design as a trinity of
     visceral+behavioral+reflective)
   * etc
** How
   Understanding the mechanisms can help a little, knowledge is power, but
   good tricks will work even on someone who knows them. Some books:
*** Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness
*** Influence: Science and Practice
*** Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping
*** Persuasion, Social Influence, and Compliance Gaining
*** How Customers Think: Essential Insights into the Mind of the Market
*** The Gamification Revolution: How Leaders Leverage Game Mechanics to Crush the Competition

* Misconceptions (things just wrong)
** One can resist mind tricks
*** a good mind trick will work on someone that know it
** Engaging with brands
*** should never be more important for any company than "people happily using our products/services"
**** should never be a wan of any person

* Avoiding tricks
** Books that help avoiding tricks
*** Thinking fast and slow
*** The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Consumption
*** Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength
** Techniques
*** Apparently meditation may help some
*** Mindfulness
**** what books on it
*** Techniques for avoiding exposure
**** which ones?
